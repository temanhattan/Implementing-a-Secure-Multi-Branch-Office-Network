# Secure Multi-Branch Office Network Implementation

## Project Description

This project involves designing and implementing a secure multi-branch office network for a company with a main office and three branch offices. The network prioritizes reliable connectivity, secure communication, and internet access. Key requirements include site-to-site VPNs, network segmentation using VLANs, and robust security measures.

## Network Design

* **Topology:**
    * A star topology is implemented, with the main office acting as the central hub.
    * Routers, switches, and firewalls are used to connect the offices.
    * Internet connectivity is provided at the main office.
* **IP Addressing and VLANs:**
    * A structured IP addressing scheme is used for each office.
    * VLANs are configured to segment departments (HR, Finance, Sales).
    * Subnetting is implemented to optimize network efficiency.
* **VPN:**
    * Site-to-site IPsec VPNs are established between the main office and each branch office for secure inter-office communication.

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Network Configuration:**
    * Routers and switches are configured at each office.
    * VLANs and inter-VLAN routing are set up.
    * Routing protocols (e.g., OSPF) are configured.
2.  **VPN Setup:**
    * IPsec VPNs are implemented and configured.
3.  **Firewall Configuration:**
    * Firewalls are configured to protect each office network.
    * Security policies are implemented to control traffic.

## Security Measures

* **Security Hardening:**
    * Network devices are secured by changing default credentials and disabling unused ports.
    * Firmware updates are applied.
* **Intrusion Detection and Prevention:**
    * IDS/IPS systems are configured to monitor and detect threats.
* **Logging and Monitoring:**
    * Logging is enabled for network devices.
    * Monitoring tools are used to track network performance and security events.

## Testing and Validation

* **Functional Testing:**
    * Connectivity between offices, VPN functionality, and VLAN segmentation are verified.
    * Internet access and internal resource accessibility are tested.
* **Security Testing:**
    * Security assessments are conducted to identify vulnerabilities.
    * VPN and firewall rules are tested.

## Documentation

* Comprehensive documentation is created, including:
    * Network diagrams.
    * VPN configurations.
    * IP addressing schemes.
    * Security policies.
    * Troubleshooting procedures.

## Tools Used

* Cisco Packet Tracer
